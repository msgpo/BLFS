<title>Introduction</title>

<para>The shadowfax <application>Subversion</application>
(<acronym>SVN</acronym>) server provides services for all of the *LFS projects
(and some others).  The tree which we are interested in for BLFS editing is
(unsurprisingly) the BLFS tree.  A complete list of the modules which are
available can be found using the interface at <ulink
url="http://svn.linuxfromscratch.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=BLFS"/>.</para>

<para>There are two types of SVN access provided to the BLFS tree: anonymous
read-only access which anyone can use and read-write access granted to active
editors who have belgarath accounts with membership in the appropriate groups.</para>

<section id="ch02-anonsvn">
<title>Anonymous Access</title>

<para>To get anonymous access, simply use the following command:

<screen><userinput>svn co svn://linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/trunk/</userinput></screen>

</para>

<para>This will create a BLFS directory and copy the current working
tree into it.  When you wish to update your local copy (often called a
sandbox), simply cd into the directory and run:

<screen><userinput>svn update</userinput></screen></para>

<section id="ch02-svnssh">
<title>SVN SSH Access (for editors)</title>

<para>For editors, access is slightly more complicated.  You first of all need
to generate yourself an ssh key-pair.  You then need to upload your public key
into your <filename>~/.ssh</filename> directory on belgarath.  To generate the
keys run: <screen><userinput>ssh-keygen -t dsa</userinput></screen> When
prompted as to where to save them, it's probably best to leave them in ~/.ssh
(as <filename>id_dsa</filename> and <filename>id_dsa.pub</filename>) unless you
already have ssh keys there.  You can use a null prassphrase, but use of
ssh-agent with a good password is recommended.  Having generated your keys,
upload <filename>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</filename> to belgarath and move it to
<filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys2</filename> <emphasis>on belgarath</emphasis>.
Your local copy of <filename>id_dsa</filename> and
<filename>id_dsa.pub</filename> should remain untouched by this.</para>


<para>If your local userid and your belgarath userid differ, you will
need to create a <filename>~/.ssh/config</filename> file on your local system
with the contents:

<screen>Host svn.linuxfromscratch.org
User &lt;belgarath-userid&gt;
RhostsRSAAuthentication yes</screen>
</para>

<para>Once you have this setup, try to checkout the BLFS tree using:
<screen><userinput>svn co svn+ssh://linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/trunk/</userinput></screen>
If this works, you'll get a nice trunk directory listing and you have
your own sandbox!.  You also have write access so from now on be extra
careful but note that <emphasis>no</emphasis> changes will be made until
you use a <userinput>svn commit</userinput> command.</para>

<para>As with anonymous access, you can update your local copy by simply cd'ing
into the appropriate directory and running: 

<screen><userinput>svn update</userinput></screen>
</para>
