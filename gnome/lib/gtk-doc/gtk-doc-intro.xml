<para>The gtk-doc package contains a code documentor. This is useful for
extracting specially-formatted comments from the code to create API
documentation.  This package is <emphasis>optional</emphasis>, if it is not
installed, packages will not build the documentation. This does not mean
that you will not have any documentation, if gtk-doc is not available,
the install process will copy pre-built documentation to your system.  If you choose to install this package, you will need to follow the hint titled <ulink
url="http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/docbook.txt">Installing
Docbook DTDs and Tools</ulink> to centralize the catalogs, add
additional dtd's and dsssl templates and install openjade.</para>

<para>You also need to add dtd v3.0 to your collection, and finally, you need to modify dtd-3.1 by adding <ulink url="http:www.labs.redhat.com/png/png-support.html">png-support-3.1.dtd</ulink> to <filename>/usr/share/sgml/docbook/sgml-dtd-3.1</filename> and placing:
<screen>PUBLIC "-//GNOME//DTD DocBook PNG Variant V1.1//EN" "png-support-3.1.dtd"</screen>
into the DocBook driver file section of
<filename>/usr/share/sgml/docbook/sgml-dtd-3.1/catalog</filename>.</para>
