<title>Installation of <application>cracklib</application></title>

<para>First, we need to install the chosen word list for cracklib:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>install -d -m755 /usr/share/dict &amp;&amp;
install -m644 <replaceable>[wordlist]</replaceable> /usr/share/dict &amp;&amp;
ln -sf <replaceable>[wordlist]</replaceable> /usr/share/dict/words &amp;&amp;
echo $(hostname) >> /usr/share/dict/extra.words</command></userinput></screen>

<para>Our wordlist is linked to
<filename>/usr/share/dict/words</filename> as historically,
<filename>words</filename> is the primary wordlist in the
<filename class="directory">/usr/share/dict</filename> directory.  We
also echo the value of hostname to a file called extra.words.  This
extra file is intened to be a site specific list which includes easy to 
guess passwords such as company or department name, user's names, 
product names, computer name, domain name, etc.</para>

<para>Now apply BLFS patch:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>patch -Np1 -i ../cracklib,&cracklib-version;-blfs-1.patch</command></userinput></screen>

<para>If necessary, apply the heimdal patch:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>cp -R cracklib cracklib_krb5 &amp;&amp;
patch -Np1 -i ../cracklib,&cracklib-version;-heimdal-1.patch</command></userinput></screen>

<para>Finally install the package:</para>
<screen><userinput><command>make install</command></userinput></screen>
