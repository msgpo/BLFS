<title>Configuring for Network Filesystems</title>

<para>While <acronym>LFS</acronym> is capable of mounting network file
systems such as <acronym>NFS</acronym>, these are not mounted by the
<filename>mountfs</filename> init script.  The tools needed to mount
these systems may not be available on the root partition and the
network file systems need to be mounted after the networking is activated.
These file systems also need to be unmounted before the network goes down.</para>

<para>Install the <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/netfs</filename>
network mount script included with the
<xref linkend="intro-important-bootscripts"/> package.</para>
