<para>The <filename>shells</filename> file contains a list of 
login shells on the system. Applications use this file to determine
whether a shell is valid. For each shell a single line should be
present, consisting of the shell's path, relative to root.</para>

<para>For example, this file is consulted by <command>chsh</command> to
determine whether a normal user may change the login shell for her
own account. If the command name is not listed, the user will be denied of
change.</para>

<para>It is a requirement for applications such as
<acronym>GDM</acronym> which does not populate the face browser if it
can't find <filename>/etc/shells</filename> or <acronym>FTP</acronym>
daemons which traditionally disallow access to users with shells not
included in this file.</para>
