<para>Inputrc deals with the mapping of the keyboard for certain
situations.  This file is the start-up file used by readline - the input
related library used by Bash and most other shells.</para>

<para>For more information see <filename>info bash</filename> -- Node:
Readline Init file as well as <filename>info readline</filename>. There
is a lot that can be done with this one rc file.</para>

<para>The following is a base <filename>/etc/inputrc</filename> along with
comments to explain what the various options do.</para>

<para>Please note that comments can <emphasis>not</emphasis> be on the
same line as commands in <filename>inputrc</filename>.</para>

<para>Global values are set in <filename>/etc/inputrc</filename>.
Personal user values as are set in <filename>~/.inputrc</filename>. The
<filename>~/.inputrc</filename> file will override the global settings
file.  The previous page sets up Bash to use
<filename>/etc/inputrc</filename> by default.  If you want your system
to use both, it might be a good idea to place a default
<filename>.inputrc</filename> into the <filename>/etc/skel</filename>
directory for use with new users.</para>
