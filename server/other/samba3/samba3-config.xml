<title>Configuring <application>Samba</application></title>
<para>Because of the infinate number of possible uses for 
<application>Samba</application>, configuration is well beyond the scope
of the BLFS book.  In fact, many complete books have been written on
this topic alone.  The included documentation, a popular book published by
O'Reilly, can be viewed by pointing your web browser to:</para>
<para><screen><userinput>file:///usr/share/samba/swat/using_samba/toc.html</userinput></screen></para>

<!--
<para>There are also several other resources availible on the web.
Below are a few links that show in detail some very good sample
configurations.</para>

  * This is for later....as soon as I find the example configs I had the
  * other day....

<para>Insert the links here along with descriptions of the 
sample configs. (use itemized list)</para>
-->

<!-- 
<para>Finally, the buit in SWAT (Samba Web Administation Tool) utility
-->
<para>The built in SWAT (Samba Web Administration Tool) utility
can be used for the very basic of configurations.  However, before 
using SWAT, you must do a little configuration.</para>  

<para>Add the swat entry to <filename>/etc/services</filename>with the 
following command: </para>

<screen><userinput><command>echo "swat            901/tcp" &gt;&gt; /etc/services</command></userinput></screen>

<para>If <command>inetd</command> is used, the following command will add the 
swat entry to <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>: </para>
<screen><userinput><command>echo "swat stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/sbin/swat swat" \
    &gt;&gt; /etc/inetd.conf</command></userinput></screen>

<para>If xinetd is used, the following command will add the swat entry
to <filename>/etc/xinetd.conf</filename>: </para>
<screen><userinput><command>cat &gt;&gt; /etc/xinetd.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"</command>
service swat
{
    port            = 901
    socket_type     = stream
    wait            = no
    only_from       = 127.0.0.1
    user            = root
    server          = /usr/sbin/swat
    log_on_failure  += USERID
}
<command>EOF</command></userinput></screen>

<para><acronym>SWAT</acronym> can be launched by pointing your web
browser to:</para>
<screen><userinput><command>http://localhost:901</command></userinput></screen>

<para>For your convenience, boot scripts have been provided for
<application>Samba</application>.  There are two included in the
<application>lfs-bootscripts</application> package.  The first,
<filename>samba</filename>, will start the <command>smbd</command> and
<command>nmbd</command> daemons needed to provide
<acronym>SMB</acronym>/<acronym>CIFS</acronym> services.  The second
script, <filename>winbind</filename>, starts the <command>winbindd</command> 
daemon, used for providing Windows domain services to Linux clients.</para>

<para>Install the <filename>samba</filename> script with the following 
command:</para>
<para><screen><userinput>make install-samba</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you also need the <filename>winbind</filename> script:</para>
<para><screen><userinput>make install-winbind</userinput></screen></para>
