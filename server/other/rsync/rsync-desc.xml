<sect3><title>rsync</title>
<para><application>rsync</application> is a replacement for <command>rcp
</command> (and <command>scp</command>) that has many more features. It
uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method of syncing remote
files. It does this by sending just the differences in the files across the
link, without requiring that both sets of files are present at one of the ends
of the link beforehand.</para></sect3>
