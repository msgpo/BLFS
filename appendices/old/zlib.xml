<warning><para>This package is deprecated from BLFS</para>
<para>The reason for the removal of this package from the main BLFS book is
that as of LFS-4.0 it is part of the main LFS book.  If you are using a
version of LFS prior to this, you still need to install it; otherwise, you
can ignore all references to dependencies on this package.</para></warning>

<para>Zlib provides compression and decompression functions to programs.
Most people will want zlib because both servers and clients are 
likely to need the openssl libraries which in turn require zlib.
Servers will want openssl because it is needed for running OpenSSH services and
clients because most web browsers need it to deal with https (secure)
websites.</para>
