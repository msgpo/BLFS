<para>As with most libraries, there is no configuration to do, save that
the library directory i.e., <filename class="directory">/opt/lib</filename> or
<filename class="directory">/usr/local/lib</filename> should appear in
<filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> so that <command>ldd</command> can find the shared
libraries.  After checking that this is the case,
<command>/sbin/ldconfig</command> should be run while logged in as
root.</para>
