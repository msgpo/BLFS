<sect3><title>Preparing your system for scanner access</title>
<para>To access your scanner, you will probably need the related kernel
drivers. A SCSI scanner will need SCSI drivers, a parallel port scanner
needs parallel port support (you should use enhanced EPP modes, too) and
an USB scanner will need the USB scanner module and a SCSI system for 
emulation. Be sure that you have got the necessary devices to access the
drivers.</para>
