<title>Asking for help and the FAQ</title>

<para>If you encounter a problem while using this book, and your problem
is not listed in the FAQ (<ulink
url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq"/>), you will find that most
of the people on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and
on the mailing lists are willing to help you. An
overview of the LFS mailing lists can be found in
<xref linkend="intro-welcome-maillists"/>. To assist us in diagnosing and solving
your problem, include as much relevant information as possible in your
request for help.</para>

<title>Things to mention</title>

<para>Apart from a brief explanation of the problem you're having, the
essential things to include in your request are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the version of the book you are using (being
&version;),</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the package or section giving you
problems,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the exact error message or symptom you are
receiving,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>whether you have deviated from the book or LFS at
all.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>(Note that saying that you've deviated from the book doesn't mean
that we won't help you. It'll just help us to see other possible causes of your problem.)</para>

<para>An excellent article on asking for help on the Internet in general
has been written by Eric S. Raymond. It is available online at <ulink
url="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"/>.
Read and follow the hints in that document and you are much more likely
to get a response to start with and also to get the help you actually
need.</para>
