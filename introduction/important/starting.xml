  <title>Getting Started After LFS</title>

  <sect2>
  <title>Deciding what to do next</title>

     <para>
       Now that LFS is complete and you have a bootable system, what do you do?
       The next step is to decide how to use it. Generally, there are two broad
       categories to consider: workstation or server. Indeed, these categories
       are not mutually exclusive. The applications needed for each category
       can be combined onto a single system, but let's look at them separately
       for now.
     </para>

     <para>
        A sever is the simplier category. Generally this consistes of a web
        server such as the 
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/server/apache.html">Apache HTTP Server</ulink>
        and a database server such as
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/server/mariadb.html">MariaDB</ulink>. 
        However other services are possible. The operating system
        embedded in a single use device falls into this category.
     </para>

     <para>
        On the other hand, a workstation is much more complex. It generally
        requires a graphical user environment such as 
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/lxde/lxde.html">LXDE</ulink>, 
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/xfce/xfce.html">XFCE</ulink>, 
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/kde/kde.html">KDE</ulink>, or 
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/gnome/gnome.html">Gnome</ulink>
        (systemd versions of LFS only) based on the 
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/x/installing.html">X Window graphical environment</ulink>
        and several graphical based applications such as the
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/xsoft/firefox.html">Firefox web browser</ulink>, 
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/xsoft/thunderbird.html">Thunderbird email client</ulink>,
        or 
        <ulink url="&blfs-book;/xsoft/libreoffice.html">LibreOffice office suite</ulink>. 
        These applications require many (several hundred depending on
        desired capabilities) more packages of support applications and
        libraries.
     </para>

     <para>
        In addition to the above, there is a set of applications that are
        suitable for all systems for system management. These applications are
        all in the full BLFS book but are repeated here for convenience. Not
        all packages are needed in all environments. For example 
        <xref linkend='dhcpcd'/>
        is not appropriate for a server and 
        <xref linkend='wireless_tools'/>
        are normally only
        useful for a laptop system. If you are not sure if a package presented
        here is needed or not, it can either be installed now or later as the
        need arises.
     </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
  <title>Working in a partial BLFS environment</title>

    <para>
      When you initially boot into LFS, you have all the interal tools to build
      additional packages. Unfortunately, the user environment is quite sparse.
      There are a couple of ways to improve this: 
    </para>

  <sect3>
  <title>Work from the LFS host in chroot</title>

    <para>
      This method provides a complete graphical environment where a full
      featured browser and copy/paste capabilites are available. This method
      allows using applications like the host's version of wget to download
      package sources to a location available when working in the chroot
      envirnment.
    </para>

    <para>
       In order to properly build packages in chroot, you will also need to
       remember to mount the virtual file systems if they are not already
       mounted. One way to do this is to create a script on the 
       <command>HOST</command> system:
    </para>

<screen><command>cat &gt; ~/mount-virt.sh &lt;&lt; "EOF"
#!/bin/bash

function mountbind
{
   if ! mountpoint $LFS/$1 >/dev/null; then
     $SUDO mount --bind /$1 $LFS/$1 
     echo $LFS/$1 mounted
   else
     echo $LFS/$1 already mounted
   fi
}

function mounttype
{
   if ! mountpoint $LFS/$1 >/dev/null; then
     $SUDO mount -t $2 $3 $4 $5 $LFS/$1 
     echo $LFS/$1 mounted
   else
     echo $LFS/$1 already mounted
   fi
}

if [ $EUID -ne 0 ]; then
  SUDO=sudo
else
  SUDO=""
fi

if [ x$LFS == x ]; then
  echo "LFS not set"
  exit 1
fi

mountbind dev 
mounttype dev/pts devpts devpts -o gid=5,mode=620
mounttype proc    proc   proc
mounttype sys     sysfs  sysfs
mounttype run     tmpfs  run
mkdir $LFS/run/shm
#mountbind usr/src
#mountbind boot
#mountbind home
EOF</command></screen>

    <para>
       Note that the last three commands inthe script are commented out. These
       are useful if those directories are mounted as separate partitons on the
       host system and will be mounted when booting the completed LFS/BLFS system. 
    </para>

    <para>
        The script can be run with <command>bash ~/mount-virt.sh</command> as
        either a regular user (recommended) or as root. If run as a regular
        user, sudo is required on the host system.
    </para>

    <para>
        Another issue pointed out by the scriptis where to store downloaded
        package files. This location is arbitrary. It can be in a regular
        user's home directory such as ~/sources or in a global location like
        /usr/src. Our recommendation is not to mix BLFS sources and LFS sources
        in (from the chroot environment) /sources. In any case, the packages
        must be accessible inside the chroot environment.
    </para>

    <para>
        A last convenince feature presented here is to streamline the process
        of entering the chroot environment. This can be done with an alias
        placed in a user's ~/.bashrc file on the host system:
    </para>

<screen><command>alias lfs='sudo /usr/sbin/chroot /mnt/lfs /usr/bin/env -i HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1="\u:\w\\\\$ " 
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin /bin/bash --login'</command></screen>

     <para>
       This alias is a little tricky because of the quoting and levels of
       backslash characters. It must be all on a single line. The above command
       has been split in two for presentation purposes.
    </para>

  </sect3>

  <sect3>
  <title>Work remotely via ssh</title>

    <para>
       This method also provides a full graphical environment, but first
       requires installing 
       <xref linkend='sshd'/> and 
       <xref linkend='wget'/>
       on the LFS system, usually in chroot. It also requires a second
       computer. This method has the advantage of being simple by not requiring
       the complexity of the chroot environment. It also uses your LFS built
       kernel for all additional packages and still provides a complete system
       for installing packages. 
    </para>
