<title>Optional Patches</title>

<para>As you follow the various sections in the book, you will observe that
the book includes various patches that are required for a successful and
secure installation of the packages. The general policy of the book is to
include patches that fall in one of the following criteria:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Fixes a compilation problem.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Fixes a security problem.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Fixes a broken functionality.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>In short, the book only includes patches that are either Required or
Recommended. There is a <ulink url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches">Patches subproject</ulink>
which hosts various patches (including the patches included in the books)
to enable you to configure your <acronym>LFS</acronym> the way you like it.</para>
