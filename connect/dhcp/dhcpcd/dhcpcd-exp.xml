<para><command>patch -Np1 -i ../dhcpcd-&dhcpcd-version;-fhs.patch
</command>: <application>Dhcpcd</application> unpatched puts all configuration 
and temporary files in <filename>/etc/dhcpc</filename>. This becomes very 
annoying when <application>dhcpcd</application> tells you it's running and it's 
not.  You look in <filename class="directory">/var/run</filename> for
the <filename>PID</filename> file, but it's not 
there, the <filename>PID</filename> file that needs deleting is in
<filename class="directory">/etc/dhcpc</filename>. 
This patch brings this program into <acronym>FHS</acronym> compliance, but more 
importantly, puts files where you expect them to be.</para>

<para><parameter>--prefix=""</parameter>: There may be a good reason for
abandoning the normal <acronym>BLFS</acronym> convention of using
<parameter>--prefix=/usr</parameter> here.  If you are installing 
<acronym>DHCP</acronym>, it is likely that it is 
required during the boot process and 
<filename class="directory">/usr</filename> may be network 
mounted in which case, <command>dhcpcd</command> wouldn't be available due to 
being on the network!  Therefore, depending on your situation, you may want it 
to be installed in <filename class="directory">/sbin</filename> or 
<filename class="directory">/usr/sbin</filename>.  This command installs to 
<filename class="directory">/sbin</filename>.</para>

<para><parameter>--sysconfdir=/var/lib</parameter>: This command install
configuration files in the <filename class="directory">/var/lib</filename>
directory.</para>

<para><parameter>--mandir=/usr/share/man</parameter>: This command
install the man pages to the <filename class="directory">/usr/share/man</filename>
directory.</para>
