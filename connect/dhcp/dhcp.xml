<title><acronym>DHCP</acronym> Clients</title>

<para><acronym>DHCP</acronym> stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  
It is a protocol which is used by many sites to automatically provide
information such as <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses, subnet masks and routing 
information to computers.  If your network uses <acronym>DHCP</acronym>, you 
will need a <acronym>DHCP</acronym> client in order to connect to it.
<acronym>DHCP</acronym> is also used by some cable modems.</para>

<para>We currently provide installation instructions for two
<acronym>DHCP</acronym> clients, <command>dhclient</command> (from the
<application>dhcp</application> package) and <command>dhcpcd</command>.  We 
begin with a page which shows how to alter the <acronym>LFS</acronym> 
boot scripts for generic <acronym>DHCP</acronym> support. We then present the 
two sets of installation instructions which also discuss 
how to create an appropriate configuration file to work with the 
<acronym>DHCP</acronym> client of your choice.</para>
