<title><acronym>DHCP</acronym> Clients</title>

<para><acronym>DHCP</acronym> stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. 
It is a protocol used by many sites to automatically provide information such 
as <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses, subnet masks and routing information to 
computers.  If your network uses <acronym>DHCP</acronym>, you will need a 
<acronym>DHCP</acronym> client in order to connect to it. 
<acronym>DHCP</acronym> is also used by some cable modems.</para>

<para><acronym>BLFS</acronym> currently provides installation instructions for 
two <acronym>DHCP</acronym> clients, <command>dhclient</command> (from the 
<application>dhcp</application> package) and <command>dhcpcd</command>. 
<acronym>BLFS</acronym> presents both sets of installation instructions and 
discusses how to create an appropriate service script to work with the 
<command>network</command> bootscript and the <acronym>DHCP</acronym> 
client of your choice.</para>
