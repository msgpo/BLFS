<title>DHCP Clients</title>

<para>DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  It is a
protocol which is used by many sites to automatically provide
information such as IP addresses, subnet masks and routing information
to computers.  If your network uses DHCP, you will need a DHCP client
in order to connect to it.  DHCP is also used by some cable
modems.</para>

<para>We currently provide installation instructions for two DHCP
clients, dhclient (from the dhcp package) and dhcpcd.  We begin with a page
which shows how to alter the LFS bootscripts for generic DHCP support.
We then present the two sets of installation instructions which also discuss 
how to create an appropriate configuration file to work with the 
DHCP client of your choice.</para>
