<title>Foreword</title>

<para>Having helped out with Linux From Scratch for a short time, I
noticed that we were getting many queries as to how to do things beyond
the base <acronym>LFS</acronym> system.  At the time, the only assistance 
specifically offered relating to <acronym>LFS</acronym> were the
<acronym>LFS</acronym> hints (<ulink url="&hints-root;">&hints-root;</ulink>). 
Most of the <acronym>LFS</acronym> hints are extremely good and well written 
but I (and others) could still see a need for more comprehensive help to 
go Beyond <acronym>LFS</acronym> - hence <acronym>BLFS</acronym>.</para>

<para><acronym>BLFS</acronym> aims to be more than the
<acronym>LFS</acronym>-hints converted to <acronym>XML</acronym> although
much of our work is based around the hints and indeed some authors write
both hints and the relevant <acronym>BLFS</acronym> sections.  We hope that 
we can provide you with enough information to not only manage to build your 
system up to what you want, whether it be a web server or a multimedia desktop
system, but also that you will learn a lot about system configuration as
you go.</para>

<para>Thanks as ever go to everyone in the <acronym>LFS</acronym>/<acronym>BLFS</acronym> 
community especially those who have contributed instructions, written text, 
answered questions and generally shouted when things were wrong!</para>

<para>Finally, we encourage you to become involved in the community; ask 
questions on the mailing list or news gateway and join in the fun on #lfs at 
irc.linuxfromscratch.org. You can find more details about all of these in the 
<xref linkend="introduction"/> section of the book.</para>

<para>Enjoy using <acronym>BLFS</acronym>.</para>

<para>I still remember how I found the <acronym>BLFS</acronym> project
and started using the instructions that were completed at the time.  I could 
not believe how wonderful it was to get an application up and running very 
quickly, with explanations as to why things were done a certain way.
Unfortunately, for me, it wasn't long before I was opening applications that 
had nothing more  than "To be done" on the page.  I did what most would do, 
I waited for someone else to do it.  It wasn't too long before I am looking 
through  <application>Bugzilla</application> for something easy to do.
As with any learning experience, the definition of what was easy kept
changing.</para>

<para>We still encourage you to become involved as <acronym>BLFS</acronym> is 
never really finished.  Contributing or just using, we hope you enjoy
your <acronym>BLFS</acronym> experience.</para>
