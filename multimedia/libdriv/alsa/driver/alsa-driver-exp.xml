<title>Command explanations</title>

<para><command>--with-sequencer=yes</command> : This tells the
alsa-driver package to build the sequencer modules for whichever soundcards
for which you are building. Most people want them so you will usually want to
leave it set to yes.</para>

<para><command>--with-oss=yes</command> : This tells the package to
build the <acronym>OSS</acronym>/Free emulation modules. Again, most people want this so it's
probably best to stick with yes.</para>

<para><command>--with-isapnp=no</command> : Most sound cards these days
are <acronym>PCI</acronym> and so <acronym>ISA</acronym> Plug and Play 
support isn't needed. If you are using an
<acronym>ISA</acronym> soundcard, it's best to say yes here.</para>

<para><command>--with-cards=all</command> : You can tell the script just
to build the drivers for your particular sound card here. For full information
on which drivers are available see <command>./configure
--help</command>. If you aren't sure which chipset your soundcard uses,
have a look in <filename>CARDS-STATUS</filename> in the alsa-driver source
tree. The default specified here will build all drivers.</para>
