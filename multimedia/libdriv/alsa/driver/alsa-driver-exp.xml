<para><parameter>--with-sequencer=yes</parameter>: This tells the <application>
<acronym>ALSA</acronym> Driver</application> package to build the sequencer 
modules for whichever soundcards for which you are building. Most people want 
them so you will usually want to leave it set to yes.</para>

<para><parameter>--with-oss=yes</parameter>: This tells the package to
build the <acronym>OSS</acronym>/Free emulation modules. Again, most people 
want this so it's probably best to stick with yes.</para>

<para><parameter>--with-isapnp=no</parameter>: Most sound cards these days
are <acronym>PCI</acronym> and so <acronym>ISA</acronym> Plug and Play 
support isn't needed. If you are using an <acronym>ISA</acronym> PnP soundcard, 
it's best to say yes here. If your card is <acronym>ISA</acronym>, but
not PnP, it is safer to stay with 'no'.</para>

<para><parameter>--with-cards=all</parameter>: You can tell the script just
to build the drivers for your particular sound card here. For full information
on which drivers are available see <command>./configure
--help</command>. If you aren't sure which chipset your soundcard uses,
have a look in <filename>CARDS-STATUS</filename> in the
<application><acronym>ALSA</acronym> Driver</application> source
tree. The default specified here will build all drivers.</para>
