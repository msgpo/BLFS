<para>The first question which people tend to ask about <acronym>ALSA</acronym> 
is why they should use it over the sound drivers included in the kernel - there 
are several reasons.  First, the <acronym>ALSA</acronym> drivers support more 
sound cards than those in the kernel.  Second, the <acronym>OSS</acronym> 
emulation is in some cases faster and better than the original <acronym>OSS
</acronym> driver itself.  And finally, there are some programs which can use 
<acronym>ALSA</acronym>'s enhanced features to better drive the soundcard.
</para>

<para><acronym>ALSA</acronym> is also likely to be the future of Linux Sound 
(hence the name <emphasis>Advanced Linux Sound Architecture</emphasis>), and 
the <acronym>ALSA</acronym> drivers will probably be included into the main 
linux kernel at some point during the 2.5 development series, leading 
eventually to <acronym>ALSA</acronym> being the "standard" sound drivers into 
the future 2.6 stable kernel.</para>

<para>The following five sections of the book deal with the five separate
components of <acronym>ALSA</acronym>: the drivers, the libraries, the 
utilities, the tools and the <acronym>OSS</acronym> compatibility libraries.
