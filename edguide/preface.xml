<title>Welcome to the BLFS Editor's Manual</title>
<?dbhtml filename="preface.html" ?>

<para>This document is designed to be a friendly introduction to BLFS
editing.  We've put it together in order to prevent a
single "point of failure/delay" (so to speak) in the BLFS
Project.</para>

<para>This document covers a few things.  Firstly,
basic admin issues like accessing <application>Subversion</application> 
over <application>SSH</application>, committing changes and
BLFS logging policy.  Then we briefly discuss a little bit of
general BLFS policy.  </para>

<para>We hope this little document will be helpful not only to all of the
(co)editors but also to all people thinking about contributing to
BLFS.</para>
