<para><userinput>cvs commit</userinput> or <userinput>cvs
ci</userinput>.  This command recursively sends your changes to the CVS
server.  It will commit changed files, added files and deleted files.
The -m option can be used to pass a log message to the command.  If you
don't specify a -m "MESSAGE", then it will open vi (you may be able to
override this using the $EDITOR variable but I've never tried it).
Please don't use empty log messages (see later in this document on the
policy which governs them).</para>
