<para>The man and info pages of CVS are fairly good but I'm going to
list a basic set of commands which all editors will use on an almost
daily basis.  Note that quite a few things can be set in your local
<filename>~/.cvsrc</filename> file.  For example, I have in there:
<screen>cvs -z9
diff -u</screen>
This means that all options use the highest level of compression (I'm on
a dial-up link, if you're on broadband it's probably not needed to do
this.  It does entail a slightly higher processing time for both your
machine and shadowfax so think before using it) and says that I always
want the <userinput>cvs diff</userinput> command to use unified diff
format (which <emphasis>all</emphasis> e-mailed submissions (i.e. by
those without write CVS access) to <userinput>blfs-dev</userinput>
should use as they're much easier to read.  There are many more options
available, you can usually find them by doing <userinput>cvs
--help</userinput> <emphasis>command</emphasis>.  You can
also get a basic list of CVS commands by simply doing
<userinput>cvs --help-commands</userinput>.  Having said all of
this, let's get on with the commands!.</para>

<para>Some commands have two forms, the long and the short.  I'll
list both in the description.</para>
