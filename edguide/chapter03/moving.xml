<para>Moving files:  One of the (many?) complaints against cvs is that
it has no concept of 1) moving files or 2) versioning directories.  If
you need to move a file, it's generally better to do it on the server
manually.  <emphasis>If this is needed, please contact me and I'll do
it</emphasis>.  This is simply because then if something goes wrong,
it's me who takes the fall instead of anyone else!</para>
