<para><userinput>cvs diff</userinput>.  This is useful for two different
purposes.  Firstly, those without write access to the BLFS CVS server
can use it to generate patches to send to
<userinput>blfs-dev</userinput>.  To do this, simply edit the files in
your local sandbox then run <userinput>cvs diff -u &gt;
FILE.patch</userinput> from the root of your BLFS directory.  You can
then attach this file to a message to <userinput>blfs-dev</userinput>
where someone with editing rights will pick it up and apply it to the
book.  The second use is to find out what has changed between two
revisions using:
<userinput>cvs diff -u -r revision1 -r revision2 FILENAME</userinput>.
For example: <userinput>cvs diff -u -r 1.68 -r 1.69
index.xml</userinput> will output a unified diff showing the changes
between revisions 1.68 and 1.69 of <filename>index.xml</filename>.
Remember that when using cvs diff, you nearly
<emphasis>always</emphasis> want to output a unified diff and so either
use the <userinput>-u</userinput> switch or add it to
your <userinput>~/.cvsrc</userinput></para>
