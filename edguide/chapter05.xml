<title>Introduction</title>

<para>This chapter covers the things you need to do when you are using
Bugzilla for entering new bugs into the system, and fixing/updating
outstanding bugs.</para>

<para>It's assume you have already logged into Bugzilla before doing anything
outlined in the following sections.</para>

<sect2 id="ch05-addingcomments">
<title>Adding comments</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Go to the bug you want add comments to</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Add your additional information in the
<emphasis>Additional Comments</emphasis> text field.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>As the last step, click on the <emphasis>Commit</emphasis>
button to commit your changes to the database. A log of this will be sent
to the blfs-book mailinglist.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ch05-filingbug">
<title>Enter a new bug</title>

<para>You found a bug, or somebody else found a bug and you decided to add
it to Bugzilla.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Go to <ulink url="&blfs-bugzilla;"/></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Select the proper <emphasis>Version</emphasis>. You most
always will choose the <emphasis>CVS</emphasis> version. It doesn't make
sense to report a bug against an old version if it's no longer in CVS. If
it is, then CVS is newer than a previously released stable book version.
The versions are basically there only for people who don't edit the book
and who want to report a bug against the book version they
have.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Don't worry about <emphasis>Component, Platform, OS and
Severity</emphasis> Those aren't used at the moment.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Select the <emphasis>Resolution Priority</emphasis>. Use
your own judgement on how important fixing this bug is. If you're not sure
just leave the default. Priorities are periodically re-evaluated and
changed anyways (what may be P5 a month ago may be changed to a P1 now
because it's finally time to fix it).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Select the <emphasis>Initial state</emphasis>. Only select
<emphasis>UNCONFIRMED</emphasis> if you haven't checked the matter out yet
and are only suspecting a bug. Otherwise, leave it as
<emphasis>NEW</emphasis></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you don't want to assign yourself to it right away,
leave the <emphasis>Assigned To</emphasis> field blank. It'll be assigned
to <emphasis>blfs-book@linuxfromscratch.org</emphasis> then, until a real
editor changes that to himself.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Fill in the other fields as appropriate,
<emphasis>Summary</emphasis> and <emphasis>Description</emphasis> are
mandatory.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>As the last step, click on the <emphasis>Commit</emphasis>
button to commit your changes to the database. A log of this will be sent
to the blfs-book mailinglist.</para></listitem>
