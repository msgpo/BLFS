<title>Welcome to the BLFS Editor's Manual</title>
<?dbhtml filename="preface.html" dir="preface"?>

<para>This document is designed to be a friendly introduction to BLFS
editing.  I've put it together in order to remove myself from being the
single "point of failure/delay" (so to speak) in the BLFS
Project.</para>

<para>This document covers (or will soon cover) a few things.  Firstly,
basic admin issues like accessing CVS over SSH, committing changes and
BLFS logging policy.  Then I intend to briefly discuss a little bit of
general BLFS policy (which is liable to change over time as we sort it
out).  Later, I hope to add features to BLFS such as filelists similar
to those use with <filename>checklfs</filename> in the LFS book and a
section will be added to discuss the processes for creating
those.</para>

<para>I hope this little document will be helpful not only to all of the
(co)editors but also to all people thinking about contributing to
BLFS.</para>
