<para>The final part of updating the book is to update bugzilla.  I used
to be terrible at doing this but even I'm getting slightly more
disciplined these days!  This is usually as easy as going to BLFS
Bugzilla (<ulink url="&blfs-bugzilla;"/>), going to the bug and
choosing Resolve bug, changing resolution to FIXED.  Note that you
should <emphasis>not</emphasis> then go back and CLOSE the bug.  The
person who closes the bug should be a different editor who has tested
that what the bug is about has been fixed.  Basically, it's our QA
process.</para>

<para>Having completed all of this, you can now go and have a rest.
Well done, thank you and goodnight.</para>
