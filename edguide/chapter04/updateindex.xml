<sect2><title>Updating the date</title>
<para>The following elements should be updated whenever
<emphasis>any</emphasis> change (including small typo fixes) is made:
<screen>&lt;!ENTITY version "20020429"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY releasedate "April 29th, 2002"&gt;</screen>
The two dates <emphasis>must</emphasis> correspond and the first is in
the format YYYYMMDD.</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Adding / updating entities</title>
<para>Entities should be on one line (even if this requires wrapping
because of the length).  Package entities should always be added in
alphabetical order; if needed, create the &lt;-- X --&gt; divider (where
X == any letter!).  Most letters probably have their dividers by now but some
still don't.  We may soon divide <filename>index.xml</filename> into
entity files (as of the time of writing, it's a tad under 30Kb which is
too big for my liking).</para></sect2>
