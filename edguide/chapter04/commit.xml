<para>Once you are sure that everything renders and that you know which
files you wish to commit, you're ready.  At this point, I'd like to say
that it is nicer to get a set of commit emails each of which is a single
change.  So for example, if you're adding two packages, try and commit
them using two seperate commit commands.  This isn't totally necessary
but it does make it easier to look through the cvs commit emails (which
go to <userinput>blfs-book</userinput> and makes it easier to write
comments.</para>

<para>Before you actually commit, spend two seconds thinking about the
comment you are going to add.  As mentioned in the section on CVS
commands, comments should <emphasis>always</emphasis> be used when
commiting to CVS.  Even if the comment is just 'small typo fix', that'll
do.  Other usual comments are 'update to package-x.y.z' or 'add new
section BLAH'.</para>

<para>To commit, you use the <userinput>cvs commit</userinput> or
<userinput>cvs ci</userinput> command.  A good example of a commit
command could be:
<screen><userinput>cvs ci -m "add new package baldrick" index.xml \
chapter01/changelog.xml chapter01/credits.xml \
chapter17/chapter17.xml packages/b/baldrick*.xml</userinput></screen>
If you have only made the changes regarding this package to your tree,
then you can save time by simply running:
<screen><userinput>cvs ci -m "add new package
baldrick"</userinput></screen>
from the root of your local BLFS sandbox.  The first command is more
useful when you've modified files you don't want to commit at this
time.</para>
