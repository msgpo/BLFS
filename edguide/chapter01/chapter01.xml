<para>BLFS development takes place using three main systems.  Firstly,
the mailing lists <userinput>blfs-book</userinput>,
<userinput>blfs-dev</userinput> and (to a lesser extent)
<userinput>blfs-support</userinput>.  Secondly the Bugzilla tracking
system, and thirdly the CVS server where the book itself is
stored.  All of these services are provided by the server
<userinput>linuxfromscratch.org</userinput> also known as
<userinput>shadowfax.linuxfromscratch.org</userinput> or more usually,
<userinput>shadowfax</userinput>.  This single server provides mailing
lists, web hosting, CVS hosting, ftp hosting, the Bugzilla system and
basically everything we use to work on the BLFS project.</para>

<para>The actual BLFS book itself is written using Docbook-XML and at
first can seem to be a daunting tangle of files.  Basically, if you're
confused, start by looking at <filename>index.xml</filename>.  At the
bottom, you will notice that it will reference the entity &amp;book;.
Look up the entity &amp;book; and you will see that it points to the
file <filename>book/book.xml</filename>.  Continue in this way and
you'll soon be finding your way around the book like a pro!</para>

<para>Anyone can subscribe to any of the mailing lists provided by
shadowfax.  I'm not going to describe that (or the lists in detail)
here as there is a good description at
<ulink
url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mailinglists/info.shtml"/>.</para>

<para>The Bugzilla bug-tracking system for BLFS can be found at <ulink
url="&blfs-bugzilla;"/>.  In order to be able to
add, remove and edit bugs, you need to add an account and make sure you
are logged in whenever you wish to perform such an action.  You can
query and read the bug database without logging in or creating a user.
Note that all bugzilla messages are copied to the
<userinput>blfs-book</userinput> mailing list and that all editors
should be subscribed to this and the <userinput>blfs-dev</userinput>
list at a minimum.</para>

<para>Finally, there is the CVS server which will be discussed in the
following chapters.</para>
