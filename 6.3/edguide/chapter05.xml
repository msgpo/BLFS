    Trac for entering new tickets into the system, and fixing/updating
    outstanding tickets.</para>

    <para>It's assumed you have already logged into Trac before doing anything
    outlined in the following sections.</para>

    <title>Create a new ticket</title>

    <para>You found a problem, or somebody else found an issue and you decided
    to create a new ticket in Trac.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Go to <ulink url="&blfs-trac;"/></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select the proper <emphasis>Version</emphasis>. You most always
        will choose the <emphasis>SVN</emphasis> version. The other versions are
        basically there only for people who don't edit the book and who want to
        report an issue against the book version they are using.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Set the <emphasis>Milestone, Priority, and Severity</emphasis>
        as appropriate.  Use your own judgment on how important fixing this
        problem is. If you're not sure just leave the default. These values
        are periodically re-evaluated and changed anyway (what may be P5 a
        month ago may be changed to a P1 now because it's finally time to fix
        it).</para>

        <para>Use the following guidelines for priorities:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Blocker &mdash; An issue that prevents building a system 
            by the book and must be fixed as soon as possible.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Critical &mdash; Package updates that fix serious security
            holes or fix some other critical problem.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Major &mdash; An important issue but not critical in the
            sense you cannot build an application with it.  Must be fixed
            before the next release.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Normal &mdash; This includes most package updates. Should
            be fixed before the next release, but may be postponed.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Minor &mdash; Issues that would be nice to have fixed 
            in the next release.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Trivial &mdash; Textual changes that have no impact on the
            installation instructions.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If you don't want to assign yourself to it right away,
        leave the <emphasis>Assigned To</emphasis> field blank. It will be
        assigned to <emphasis>blfs-book@linuxfromscratch.org</emphasis>
        until an editor changes that to himself.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Fill in the other fields as appropriate.
        <emphasis>Summary</emphasis> and <emphasis>Description</emphasis> are
        mandatory.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>As the last step, click on the <emphasis>Submit Ticket</emphasis>
        button to commit your changes to the database. A log of this will be sent
