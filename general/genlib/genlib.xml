<title>General Libraries</title>

<para>Libraries contain code which is often required by more than
one program.  This has the advantage that each program doesn't need to
duplicate code (and risk introducing bugs), it just has to call
functions from the libraries installed on the system.  The most obvious
example of a set of libraries is <application>glibc</application> which is 
installed during the <acronym>LFS</acronym> book.  This contains all of
the <application>C</application> library functions which programs use.</para>

<para>There are two types of library, static and shared.  Shared libraries 
(usually <filename>libXXX.so</filename>) are loaded into memory from the shared
copy at runtime (hence the name).  Static libraries (<filename>libXXX.a
</filename>) are actually linked into the program executable file itself, thus 
making the program file larger.  Quite often, you will find both static and 
shared copies of the same library on your system.</para>

<para>Generally, you only need to install libraries when you are
installing software which requires functionality which they supply.  In
the <acronym>BLFS</acronym> book, each package is listed with a list of (known)
dependencies.  Thus, you can figure out which libraries you need to have
before installing that program.  If you are installing something without
using <acronym>BLFS</acronym> instructions, usually the <filename>README
</filename>  or <filename>INSTALL</filename> file will contain details of the 
programs requirements.</para>

<para>There are certain libraries which nearly <emphasis>everyone</emphasis> 
will need at some point.  In this chapter we list these and some others and 
explain why you may want to install them.</para>
