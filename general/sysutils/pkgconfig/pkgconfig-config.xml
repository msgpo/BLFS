<title>Configuring <application>pkgconfig</application></title>

<para>The default settings for <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> are
<filename>/lib/pkgconfig</filename>,
<filename>/usr/lib/pkgconfig</filename> and
<filename>/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig</filename>.  These settings are hard-coded 
and do not have to be exported with the additional paths. You may add to
<envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> by exporting additional paths on your system where pkgconfig
files are installed. Note that <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> is only needed when
compiling packages, not during run-time.</para>
