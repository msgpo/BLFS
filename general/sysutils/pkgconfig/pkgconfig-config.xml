<title>Configuring <application>pkgconfig</application></title>

<para>The default setting for <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> is
<filename>/usr/lib/pkgconfig</filename> because of the prefix we use to
install pkgconfig.  You may add to <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> by exporting 
additional paths on your system where pkgconfig files are installed. Note 
that <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> is only needed when compiling packages, 
not during run-time.</para>
