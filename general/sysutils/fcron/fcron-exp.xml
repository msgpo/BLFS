<para><command>--without-sendmail</command> : <application>Fcron</application> 
does not require an <acronym>MTA</acronym> to run but will use one, if it is 
installed, to email you the results of the <command>fcron</command> script. If 
you wish to utilize this feature change the switch to 
<command>--with-sendmail=<replaceable>[path to your MTA]</replaceable>
</command>.</para>

<para><command>--with-answer-all=no</command> : After the files are
installed, the make install script enters into a configuration routine.
The first test will be whether to install a boot script in the <filename
class="directory">/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename> directory with the 
appropriate symbolic links in runlevels 2, 3, 4, and 5. The second is to 
stop any current fcron processes and start a new one. Since this is
probably your first install and we want a boot script based upon the
<acronym>BLFS</acronym> template we answer 'n' to both tests.</para>

<para><command>--with-dsssl-dir=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets-&docbook-dsssl-version;
</command> : Can be added if you have installed
<application>OpenJade</application> and
dsssl-stylesheets to generate the documentation from the DocBook source
files.</para>
