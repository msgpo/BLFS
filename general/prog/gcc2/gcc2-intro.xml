<para>There are two reasons for installing gcc2. The first is that the kernel
developers have certified gcc2 as the preferred compiler for compiling the
kernel. The other (and more compelling reason) is that some
commercial closed-source packages (such as Netscape Navigator, Yahoo Pager)
and precompiled packages (such as Mozilla)
are linked against gcc2 libs.</para>
