<para><command>--noninteractive</command> : This switch is used to
avoid the configuration routine asking for confirmation of the
directories to install to (which we pass using switches to configure
anyways).</para> 

<para><command>--with-DIR_MAN=/usr/share/man</command> : This is
used because despite the fact we pass
<command>--prefix=/usr</command>, the configure
routine tries to install the man pages in
<filename>/usr/local/man</filename> instead of the
correct place.</para>
