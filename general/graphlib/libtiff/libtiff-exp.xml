<para><userinput>--noninteractive</userinput> : This switch is used to
avoid the configuration routine asking for confirmation of the
directories to install to (which we pass using switches to configure
anyways).</para> 

<para><userinput>--with-DIR_MAN=/usr/share/man</userinput> : This is
used because despite the fact we pass --prefix=/usr, the configure
routine tries to install the man pages in /usr/local/man instead of the
correct place.</para>
