<para><screen><command>sed 's|/usr/local|/usr|' conf-home &gt; conf-home~
mv conf-home~ conf-home
sed 's/bin/sbin/' hier.c &gt; hier.c~
mv hier.c~ hier.c</command></screen> 
These commands change the installation directory to
<filename class="directory">/usr/sbin</filename> from the default 
of <filename class="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename>. Since these tools 
are used in conjunction with daemons, they don't make much sense in general 
user directories. However, some of the example programs and the 
<command>tcpclient</command> program might be of use to non-root users. 
If you wish to make these available, then we would suggest installing as above, 
and then executing the following commands: 
<screen><command>cd /usr/sbin mv tcpclient *@ mconnect delcr addcr tcpcat /usr/bin</command></screen>
This will place the client related programs into <filename>/usr/bin</filename> 
for general use.</para>
