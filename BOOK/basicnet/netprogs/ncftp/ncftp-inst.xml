<title>Installation of <application>ncftp</application></title>

<para>There are two ways to build <application>ncftp</application>.  The first 
(and optimal) way, builds most of the functionality as a shared library and 
then builds and installs the program linked against this library.  The second 
method simply links all of the functionality into the binary statically.  This
doesn't make the dynamic library available for linking by other
applications.  You need to choose which method best suits you.  Note
that the second method does <emphasis>not</emphasis> create an entirely
statically linked binary; only the <filename>libncftp</filename> parts are 
statically linked in, in this case. Be aware that building and using the shared 
library is covered by the Clarified Artistic License; however, developing 
applications that utilize the shared library is subject to a different license.
</para>

<para>To install <application>ncftp</application> using the first (and optimal) 
method, run the following commands:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
cd libncftp &amp;&amp;
make shared &amp;&amp;
make soinstall &amp;&amp;
cd .. &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</command></userinput></screen>

<para>To install <application>ncftp</application> using the second method (with 
the <filename>libncftp</filename> functionality linked in statically) run the 
following commands:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</command></userinput></screen>
