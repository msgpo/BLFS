<title>Welcome to <acronym>BLFS</acronym></title>
<para>The Beyond Linux From Scratch book is designed to carry on from
where the <acronym>LFS</acronym> book leaves off.  But unlike the <acronym>LFS
</acronym> book, it isn't designed to be followed straight through.  Reading 
the <xref linkend="intro-welcome-whichsections"/> part of this chapter should
help guide you through the book.</para>

<para>Please read most of this part of the book carefully as it explains
quite a few of the conventions we use throughout the book.</para>
