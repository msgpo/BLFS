<title>Using <acronym>BLFS</acronym> Boot Scripts</title>

<para>The scripts included for packages such as <xref linkend="gpm"/>
and <xref linkend="alsa"/> are based around the template supplied with
the lfs-bootscripts package from version 3.2 and later of the <acronym>
LFS</acronym> book. Note that this is lfs-bootscripts-1.6 and later (the old 
numbering changed as of <acronym>LFS</acronym>-3.2).  The scripts won't work 
with versions of <acronym>LFS</acronym> before 3.2 because of a change in their 
organization with the new scripts.  However, it should be trivial to adapt the 
scripts if needed for older <acronym>LFS</acronym> versions.</para>
