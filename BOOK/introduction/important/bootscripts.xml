<title><acronym>LFS</acronym> Boot Scripts</title>

<para>The lfs-bootscripts package that was used in <acronym>LFS</acronym> also
contains bootscripts for <acronym>BLFS</acronym>.
Refer to <ulink url="&lfs-root;/chapter07/bootscripts.html"/> for more
information on the lfs-bootscripts package.</para>

<para>The lfs-bootscripts package will be used throughout the <acronym>BLFS</acronym>
the book for startup scripts.  Unlike <acronym>LFS</acronym>, each init script
has a seperate install target in the lfs-bootscrits package. 
It is recomended you keep the package
source directory around until completion of your
<acronym>BLFS</acronym> system.  When a script is requested from
lfs-bootscritps, simply change to the directory and execute the given
<command>make install-&lt;init-script&gt;</command> command. This command installs the
init script to its proper location (along with any auxillary configuration
scripts) and also creates the appropriate symlinks to start and stop the
service at the appropriate run-level.</para>

<note><para>It is advisable to peruse each bootscript before installation to
ascertain that it satisfies your need. Also verify that the start and stop
symlinks it creates match your preferences.</para></note>
