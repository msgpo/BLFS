<para>The lfs-bootscripts package that was used in <acronym>LFS</acronym> also
contains bootscripts for <acronym>BLFS</acronym>.
The lfs-bootscripts package will be used throughout the rest of
the book for startup scripts.  It is recomended you keep the package
source directory around until completion of your
<acronym>BLFS</acronym> system.  When a script is requested from
lfs-bootscritps, simply change to the directory and execute the given
<command>make install-&lt;init-script&gt;</command> command. This command installs the
init script to its proper location (along with any auxillary configuration
scripts) and also creates the appropriate symlinks to start and stop the
service at the appropriate run-level.</para>

<para>If you are installing <acronym>BLFS</acronym>
from an older version of LFS, see the INSTALL included in the package for
upgrade instructions.</para>

ascertain that it satisfies your need. Also verify that the start and stop
symlinks it creates match your preferences.</para></note>
