<title>/etc/inputrc</title>

<para><filename>inputrc</filename> deals with the mapping of the keyboard for 
certain situations.  This file is the start-up file used by
<application>readline</application> - the input related library used by 
<application>Bash</application> and most other shells.</para>

<para>For more information see <command>info bash</command> -- <emphasis
role="strong">Node: Readline Init</emphasis> file as well as
<command>info readline</command>. There is a lot that can be done with this 
one rc file.</para>

<para>The following is a base <filename>/etc/inputrc</filename> along with
comments to explain what the various options do.</para>

<para>Please note that comments can <emphasis>not</emphasis> be on the
same line as commands in <filename>inputrc</filename>.</para>

<screen><userinput><command>cat &gt; /etc/inputrc &lt;&lt; "EOF"</command>

<para>Global values are set in <filename>/etc/inputrc</filename>.
Personal user values as are set in <filename>~/.inputrc</filename>. The
<filename>~/.inputrc</filename> file will override the global settings
file.  The previous page sets up <application>Bash</application> to use
<filename>/etc/inputrc</filename> by default.  If you want your system
to use both, it might be a good idea to place a default
<filename>.inputrc</filename> into the <filename>/etc/skel</filename>
directory for use with new users.</para>
