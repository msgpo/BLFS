<title>Configuring for Network Filesystems</title>

<para>While <acronym>LFS</acronym> is capable of mounting network file
systems such as <acronym>NFS</acronym> these are not mounted by
<filename>mountfs</filename> init script since the tools needed to mount
these systems may not be available on the root partition and also since
network file systems need to be mounted after the networking is on and
need to be unmounted before the network goes down.</para>

<para>Install the <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/netfs</filename>
network mount script included with the
<xref linkend="intro-important-bootscripts"/> package.</para>
