<title>Security</title>

<para>Security takes many forms in a computing environment. This chapter
gives examples of three different types of security: access, prevention
and detection.</para>

<para>Access for users is usually handled by <command>login</command> or an 
application designed to handle the login function.  In this chapter, we show 
how to enhance <command>login</command> by setting policies with
<application><acronym>PAM</acronym></application> modules.  Access via networks
can also be secured by policies set by <application>iptables</application>, 
commonly referred to as a firewall.</para>

<para>Prevention of breaches, like a trojan, are assisted by applications like 
<application>GnuPG</application>, specifically the ability to confirm signed 
packages, which prevents modification of the <acronym>TAR</acronym> ball after 
the packager creates it.</para>

<para> Finally, we touch on detection with a package that stores "signatures" 
of critical files (defined by the administrator) and then regenerates those 
"signatures" and compares for files that have been changed.</para>
