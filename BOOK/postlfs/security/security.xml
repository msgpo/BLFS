<title>Security</title>

<para>Security takes many forms in a computing environment. This chapter
gives examples of three different types of security; access, prevention
and detection.  Access for users is usually handled by
<command>login</command> or an application designed to handle the login
function.  In this chapter, we show how to enhance
<command>login</command> by setting policies with
<application><acronym>PAM</acronym></application> modules.  Access via networks
can also be secured by policies set by
<application>iptables</application>. Prevention of breaches, like
trojans, are assisted by applications like <application>gnupg</application>, 
specifically the ability to confirm signed packages, which prevents 
modification of the tarball after the packager creates it. Finally, we touch on 
detection with a package that stores "signatures" and then regenerates those
"signatures" and compares for files that have been changed.</para>
