<!--
<para><command>( WORLDOPTS="" make World 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee xfree-compile.log 
   &amp;&amp; exit $PIPESTATUS )</command>: 
This command runs multiple makefiles to completely rebuild the system. 
<envar>WORLDOPTS</envar>="" disables the default setting to continue after 
encountering an error. <parameter>2&gt;&amp;1</parameter> redirects error messages 
to the same location as normal output. The <command>tee</command> command 
allows viewing of the output while logging the results to a file. The parentheses 
around the command run the entire comand in a subshell and finally the 
<command>exit $PIPESTATUS</command> ensures the result of the <command>make</command>
is returned as the result and not the result of the <command>tee</command> command.</para>

<note><para>When rebuilding <application>XFree86</application>, a separate command that may be used if only minor 
changes are made to the sources is <command>make 
Everything</command>.  This does not automatically remove generated 
files and only rebuilds those files or programs that are out 
of date.</para></note>

<para><command>ln -sf /usr/X11R6/bin /usr/bin/X11</command>,
<command>ln -sf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 /usr/lib/X11</command>, and
<command>ln -sf /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11</command>: These 
commands are present to enable other (broken) packages to build
against <application>XFree86</application>.  We do this even though the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
says:
"In general, software must not be installed or managed via the above 
symbolic links. They are intended for utilization by users only."</para>

<para><command>make  CC=/opt/gcc-2.95.3/bin/gcc -f Makefile.linux</command>: This builds the
<application>XFree86</application> compatible kernel modules using the same compiler used to compile
the kernel.</para>

<para><command>cp gamma.o radeon.o sis.o r128.o i810.o i830.o mga.o tdfx.o
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/drm/</command>: Put the kernel
module(s) where the kernel can find them. You only need to copy the driver you 
need to support your video card.</para>

<para><command>depmod -a</command>: Update the modules.dep file for module
management.</para>
