<para>XFree86 is a freely redistributable open-source implementation of the 
X Window System. XFree86 provides a client/server interface between display 
hardware (the mouse, keyboard, and video displays) and the desktop environment 
while also providing both the windowing infrastructure and a standardized 
application interface (API).</para>

<para>There are several files that need to be fetched from the download location:
<screen>X430src-1.tgz 10736 KB 
X430src-2.tgz  7776 KB   
X430src-3.tgz 12077 KB   
X430src-4.tgz 12604 KB   
X430src-5.tgz  4286 KB   
X430src-6.tgz  7886 KB   
X430src-7.tgz  9099 KB</screen></para>

<para>The first three packages are the XFree86 programs, the fourth and fifth are fonts, 
the sixth is normal documentation, and the seventh is hardcopy documentation.
There are also two packages <filename>doctools-1.3.1.tgz</filename>,  which 
contain programs to regenerate hardcopy documentation, and 
<filename>utils-1.1.0.tgz</filename>, which contain <filename>gnutar</filename>
and <filename>zlib</filename> which are already installed on an LFS system.
</para>

<para>To check your downloads for integrity, download the <filename>SUMS.md5sum</filename>
file.  Then:
<screen>md5sum X430src* &gt; md5sums &amp;&amp;
diff md5sums SUMS.md5sum</screen>
The only differences you should see are for <filename>README</filename>, 
<filename>doctools-1.3.1.tgz</filename>, and utils-1.1.0.tgz files if you did
not download them.
