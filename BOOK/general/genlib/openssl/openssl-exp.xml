<para><command>rm doc/apps/passwd.pod </command> : We do this because
otherwise <application>openssl</application> installs its passwd man page over 
the existing system one which isn't what we want.</para>

<para><screen><command>make MANDIR=/usr/share/man
make MANDIR=/usr/share/man install</command></screen> These 
commands install <application>openssl</application> with the man pages
in <filename class='directory'>/usr/share/man
</filename> instead of the default which is <filename
class='directory'>/etc/ssl/man</filename>.</para>
 
<para><command>rmdir /etc/ssl/lib</command> : This is simply a tidy-up command. For some reason, the <application>openssl</application> install routine creates
the <filename class='directory'>/etc/ssl/lib</filename> directory even though 
the libraries have been installed in <filename class='directory'>/usr/lib
</filename>.  We remove it to keep things nice and tidy!</para>
