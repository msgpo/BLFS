<para><option>no-rc5 no-idea</option>: When added to the
<command>./config</command> command, this will eliminate the building of those 
encryption methods. Patent licenses may be needed for you to utilize either of 
those methods in your projects.</para>

<para><command>rm doc/apps/passwd.pod </command>: This command prevents 
<application>Open<acronym>SSL</acronym></application> from installing its 
passwd man page over an existing man page with the same name.</para>

<para><screen><command>make MANDIR=/usr/share/man
make MANDIR=/usr/share/man install</command></screen> These 
commands install <application>OpenSSL</application> with the man pages
in <filename class='directory'>/usr/share/man</filename> instead of the 
default which is <filename class='directory'>/etc/ssl/man</filename>.</para>
 
<para><command>rmdir /etc/ssl/lib</command>: This is simply a tidy-up command. 
For some reason, the <application>openssl</application> install routine creates
the <filename class='directory'>/etc/ssl/lib</filename> directory even though 
the libraries have been installed in 
<filename class='directory'>/usr/lib</filename>.  We remove it to keep things 
nice and tidy!</para>

<para><command>chmod 755 /usr/lib/pkgconfig</command>: The installation
process modifies the rights on this directory to mode 644. This command
restores the permissions to the setting prior to installation (mode 755).</para>
