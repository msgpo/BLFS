<title>Installation of <application>DirectFB</application></title>

<note><para>DirectFB needs a Linux kernel with frame buffer support. Check
the documentation in the kernel tree
(<filename class="directory">/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/</filename>)
on how to enable the frame buffer device for your graphics
card.</para></note>

<para>Install <application>DirectFB</application> by running the
following commands:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</command></userinput></screen>

<note><para>This release is incompatible with FreeType as of version
2.1.5. The problem manifests itself at runtime with the <command>quingy</command>
application and the <command>df_fonts</command> example.</para></note>

<para>If you decided to add optional image and video providers then you
have to install DirectFB-extra package too:</para>

<screen><userinput><command>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</command></userinput></screen>

<note><para>The current version of avifile does not work with DirectFB.
You have to use the avifile version which can be found at
<ulink url="http://www.directfb.org/download/contrib/"/> or alternatively disable the
avifile video provider by calling configure with
<command>--disable-avifile</command>.</para></note>
