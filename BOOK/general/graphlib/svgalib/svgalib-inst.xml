<title>Installation of <application>SVGAlib</application></title>

<note><para>You must compile and install as root. If you don't nothing bad
will happen during compilation, but certain tools won't be able to
become setuid root which is required for proper operation. However,
this raises a risk of exposing your system to any holes in those
tools that might be used to gain root access so use with caution.</para></note>
