<title>Introduction to Gnome</title>

<para>This chapter attempts to install a complete Gnome2 desktop
environment and a limited Gnome 1.4 library environment that is
sufficient to run Gnome 1.4 applications included in this book. The
order of the pages are meant to follow the build order defined by the
Gnome2 development team as published in the <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.0/releasenotes.html">release notes</ulink>.</para>

<warning><para>While we have been successful in building Gnome2 from these
instructions, we have also experienced several oddities in compiling and
running these applications.  If these are build issues, watch for
adjustments to the instructions as we better understand this
product.</para></warning>

<para>If you don't need the Gnome 1.4 library environment, you may skip
pages that are headed (Gnome 1.4).</para>

<para>If you are building a Gnome 1.4 desktop environment, you would
install those labeled pages <emphasis>and</emphasis> any dependancies
listed on those pages whether labeled or not. Gnome packages without
pages are simply installed with:
<screen>./configure --prefix=/opt/gnome &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</screen>
These instructions are simplistic to facilitate removal of Gnome 1.4
from BLFS systems when it is no longer necessary.  These instructions
may be refined later to comply with BLFS standards for file locations,
specifically <filename>/opt/gnome/etc</filename> to
<filename>/etc</filename> and <filename>/opt/gnome/var</filename> to
<filename>/var</filename>.  You should consider using the Gnome 1.4 hint
located at <ulink url="http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org/hints"/> if you
have no interest in Gnome2.</para>
