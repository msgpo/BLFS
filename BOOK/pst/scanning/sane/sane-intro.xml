<para>SANE is short for Scanner Access Now Easy. Alas, scanner access is
not really easy, since every vendor has own protocols. The only known
protocol that should bring some unity into this chaos is the TWAIN interface,
but this is too imprecise to allow a stable scanning framework. Therefore,
SANE comes with its own protocol, so the vendor drivers can't be used.</para>

<para>SANE is split into backends and frontends. The backends are drivers
for the supported scanners. The frontends are user interfaces to access the
backends.</para>

<screen>SANE will utilize:
