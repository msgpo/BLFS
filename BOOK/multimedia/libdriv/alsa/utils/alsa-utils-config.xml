<para>Probably the easiest way to store mixer levels is to set and retrieve
them using a bootscript.  It is possible to do this with a
<userinput>post-install</userinput> line in
<filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> but this is left as an exercise for
those readers who wish to do this.</para>

<para>The <application><acronym>ALSA</acronym> Driver</application> package 
installs a script as <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound</filename>.  While it 
is possible to use this script, it contains a lot of extraneous detail which 
isn't needed on an <acronym>LFS</acronym> system and so we install the init
script <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/alsa</filename> included in the 
<xref linkend="intro-important-bootscripts"/> package.</para>

<screen><userinput><command>make install-alsa</command></userinput></screen>

<para>Note that all channels of your soundcard are muted by default. You can
use the <command>alsamixer</command> program from
<application><acronym>ALSA</acronym> Utilities</application> (or any other
<acronym>OSS</acronym> mixer) to change this.</para>

<para>Also, the first time the above script is run, it will complain that
there is no state in <filename>/etc/asound.state</filename>.  You can
prevent this by running the following commands after installing
<application><acronym>ALSA</acronym> Utilities</application>:</para>
<screen><userinput><command>touch /etc/asound.state &amp;&amp;
alsactl store</command></userinput></screen>

<para>A final note is that the lines loading <filename>sfxload</filename>
are commented out.  They are there as an example of other things you may
wish to do in the startup script.  <filename>sfxload</filename> is a
separate package of interest to SoundBlaster AWE and Live! 
users.  It is designed for loading "sound-fonts" (which are used for
<acronym>MIDI</acronym> output).  You may wish to delete these lines and add 
your own or, if you have the relevant soundcard, install <filename>sfxload
</filename> and uncomment them.</para>
