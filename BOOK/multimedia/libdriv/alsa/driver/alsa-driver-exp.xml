<para><userinput>--with-sequencer=yes </userinput>: This tells the
alsa-driver package to build the sequencer modules for whichever soundcards
you are building for.  Most people want them so you will usually want to
leave it set to yes.</para>

<para><userinput>--with-oss=yes </userinput>: This tells the package to
build the OSS/Free emulation modules.  Again, most people want this so it's
probably best to stick with yes.</para>

<para><userinput>--with-isapnp=no </userinput>: Most sound cards these days
are PCI and so ISA Plug and Play support isn't needed.  If you are using an
ISA soundcard, it's best to say yes here.</para>

<para><userinput>--with-cards=all </userinput>: You can tell the script just
to build the drivers for your particular sound card here.  For full information
on which drivers are available see <userinput>./configure
--help</userinput>.  If you aren't sure which chipset your soundcard uses,
have a look in <filename>CARDS-STATUS</filename> in the alsa-driver source
tree.  the default specified here will build all drivers.</para>
