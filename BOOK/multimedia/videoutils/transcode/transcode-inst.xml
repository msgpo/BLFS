<title>OpenDivX or Xvid?</title>

<para>OpenDivX is a free implementation of the mpeg4-codec. Alas, the 
developers at ProjectMayo didn't gratefully release their actual source in 
compileable versions, so the displeasure of the users majority canalized 
into a new project named Xvid.</para>

<para>Xvid development was interrupted in Autumn 2002 due to a code-theft 
the developers at Sigma design committed but it is continued now.</para>

<para>For worse luck, OpenDivX and Xvid are using the same header file 
names (an issue that wouldn't be resolved easily) and function namespace, 
so you'll have to choose which one to use in transcode.</para>

<para>I personally vote for Xvid, because the installation from sources
is much smoother. If you use mencoder and transcode at the same time,
you may want to choose different codecs for each.</para>
