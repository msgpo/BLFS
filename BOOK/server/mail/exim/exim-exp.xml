<para><command>sed -e ... > Local/Makefile</command> : Many of exim's
configuration options are compiled in. Here, we specify the minimum set
of options, BIN_DIRECTORY, CONFIGURE_FILE and EXIM_USER. We also defer
building the exim monitor program, which requires the X Window System
support, by commenting out the EXIM_MONITOR line in the Makefile.</para>

<para><command>ln -s exim /usr/sbin/sendmail</command> :
Create a link to sendmail for applications which need it. exim will
accept most Sendmail command line options.</para>
