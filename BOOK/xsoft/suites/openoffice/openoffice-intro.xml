<para>The openoffice is a office suite, the opensource sibling of
StarOffice.</para>

<screen>openoffice depends on:
<xref linkend="xfree86"/>, <xref linkend="j2sdk"/>,
<xref linkend="zip"/>, <xref linkend="unzip"/>, <xref linkend="tcsh"/>,
<xref linkend="which"/>.
openoffice will utilize:
<xref linkend="Linux_PAM"/> and <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</ulink>.

<para>Download the General Polygon Clipper Library from <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.cs.man.ac.uk/pub/toby/gpc/gpc231.tar.Z"/>.</para>

<para>Also download the various patches from <userinput><ulink url="&hfile-root;"/></userinput>.
The <filename>openoffice-&openoffice-version;-no-pam.patch</filename> is needed only if
Linux PAM is not installed. The <filename>openoffice-&openoffice-version;-no-mozab.patch</filename>
disables building of Mozilla Addressbook which causes build problems since OpenOffice
includes precompiled Mozilla libraries that are incompatible with LFS. The
<filename>openoffice-&openoffice-version;-test-bin-loc.patch</filename> corrects the location where
the installation scripts look for the <command>test</command> executable.</para>

<para>The source tarball only contains English language help. A localized help
content file may be available at <ulink
url="http://ftp.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/contrib/helpcontent/"/>.</para>
