<note><para>GnuCash must be run as root once before use.  Simply
executing GnuCash from an X terminal and clicking on the cancel button
is sufficient.  This must be done prior to setting up accounts as an
unprivileged user, due to the fact that GnuCash must create scheme
catalogs for itself before it is used. </para></note>
