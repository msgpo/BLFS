The configure script for GnuCash 1.6.8 is expecting to find
gtkhtml-1.0.4, which we are not installing.  gtkhtml-1.1.7 will work
with GnuCash, but we must force configure to look for the newer
libraries.  The above sed commands are necessary because not only are
the library versions different, but in the newer version of gtkhtml,
pkg-config is used to determine CFLAGS and LIBS, while previous
versions of gtkhtml used gnome-config to do the same thing.
