<para>The Roaring Penguin PPPoE package contains both a client and a 
server component that works with the client. The client allows you 
to connect to large networks that use the PPPoE protocol, common among 
ADSL providers.  The server component runs alongside the client, 
allowing you to configure other clients that send out a configuration 
request.</para>

<para>In addition, if you plan to use demand dialing, or kernel mode
PPPoE, you need to patch ppp-2.4.1 and re-install using the standard
BLFS instructions.  The patch can be downloaded from here: 
<ulink url="&hfile-root;/ppp-2.4.1-pppoe-4.patch"/>.   Additional
information about kernel mode PPPoE can be found in 
<filename>rp-pppoe-3.5/doc/KERNEL-MODE-PPPOE</filename>.</para>
