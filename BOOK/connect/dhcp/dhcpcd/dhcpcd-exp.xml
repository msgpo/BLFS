<para><command>patch -Np1 -i ../dhcpcd-&dhcpcd-version;.patch
</command> : <application>Dhcpcd</application> unpatched puts all configuration 
and temporary files in <filename>/etc/dhcpc</filename>. This becomes very 
annoying when <application>dhcpcd</application> tells you it's running and it's 
not.  You look in <filename>/var/run</filename> for the pid file, but it's not 
there, the pid file that needs deleting is in <filename>/etc/dhcpc</filename>. 
This patch brings this program into <acronym>FHS</acronym> compliance, but more 
importantly, puts files where you expect them to be.</para>

<para><command>--prefix=""</command> : There may be a good reason for
abandoning the normal <acronym>BLFS</acronym> convention of using --prefix=/usr 
here.  If you are installing <acronym>DHCP</acronym>, it is likely that it is 
required during the boot process and <filename>/usr</filename> may be network 
mounted in which case, <command>dhcpcd</command> wouldn't be available due to 
being on the network!  Therefore, depending on your situation, you may want it 
to be installed in <filename>/sbin</filename> or <filename>/usr/sbin
</filename>.  This command installs to <filename>/sbin</filename>.</para>

<para><command>--sysconfdir=/var/lib</command> : This command install
configuration files in the <filename>/var/lib</filename>
directory.</para>

<para><command>--mandir=/usr/share/man</command> : This command
install the man pages to the <filename>/usr/share/man</filename>
directory.</para>
