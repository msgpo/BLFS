<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../dhcpcd-&dhcpcd-version;.patch
:</userinput> Dhcpcd unpatched puts all configuration and temporary
files in <filename>/etc/dhcpc</filename>. This becomes very annoying
when dhcpcd tells you it's running and it's not.  You look in
<filename>/var/run</filename> for the pid file, but it's not there, the
pid file that needs deleting is in <filename>/etc/dhcpc</filename>. This
patch brings this program into FHS compliance, but more importantly,
puts files where you expect them to be.</para>

<para><userinput>--prefix="" :</userinput>There may be a good reason for
abandoning the normal BLFS convention of using --prefix=/usr here.  If
you are installing DHCP, it is likely that it is required during the
boot process and /usr may be network mounted in which case, dhcpcd
wouldn't be available due to being on the network!  Therefore, depending
on your situation, you may want it to be installed in <filename>/sbin</filename> or <filename>/usr/sbin</filename>.  This command installs to <filename>/sbin</filename>.</para>

<para><userinput>--sysconfdir=/var/lib :</userinput> This command install
configuration files in the <filename>/var/lib</filename>
directory.</para>

<para><userinput>--mandir=/usr/share/man :</userinput> This command
install the man pages to the <filename>/usr/share/man</filename>
directory.</para>
