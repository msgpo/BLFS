<para><acronym>DHCP</acronym> stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  
It is a protocol used by many sites to automatically provide
information such as <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses, subnet masks and routing 
information to computers.  If your network uses <acronym>DHCP</acronym>, you 
will need a <acronym>DHCP</acronym> client in order to connect to it.
<acronym>DHCP</acronym> is also used by some cable modems.</para>

<para><acronym>BLFS</acronym> currently provides installation instructions for two
<acronym>DHCP</acronym> clients, <command>dhclient</command> (from the
<application>dhcp</application> package) and <command>dhcpcd</command>.
<acronym>BLFS</acronym> presents both sets of installation instructions
and discuss how 
to create an appropriate service script to work with the 
<command>network</command> bootscript and the <acronym>DHCP</acronym> 
client of your choice.</para>
