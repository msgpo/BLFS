<para>The db-&db-3.1-version; package contains version &db-3.1-version; 
of the Berkeley database. Evolution needs exactly this version and not any
other, the details on "why" are in the <filename>README</filename> file distibuted with the
evolution source code. Evolution links to the library statically, hence this
book installs the db-&db-3.1-version; in /opt, which can be removed once
Evolution is compiled.</para>
