<note><para><application>GnuCash</application> must be run as root once before 
use.  Simply executing <command>gnucash</command> from an <application>X
</application> terminal and clicking on the cancel button
is sufficient.  This must be done prior to setting up accounts as an
unprivileged user, due to the fact that
<application>GnuCash</application> must create scheme
catalogs for itself before it is used. </para></note>
