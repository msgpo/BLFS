<title>Installation of galeon</title>

<para>Compiling must be done with the same compiler version and the same
optimization settings that were used on mozilla.</para>

<para>Install galeon by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=$GNOME_PREFIX &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<warning><para>These instructions do not work yet.  It appears that they may
work if mozilla is installed with the gtk toolkit installed in addition
to what we already install.  Galeon tries to link to -lgtksuperwin, but that library isn't built under the gtk2 toolkit, just the gtk toolkit.</para></warning>
