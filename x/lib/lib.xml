<title>X Libraries</title>

<para>This chapter does not contain libraries that are required to run
<application>X</application>.  It does contain libraries that enhance
<application>X</application>.  The enhancement is as simple as font
support or as complex as libraries that sit between
<application>X</application> and applications that run on
<application>X</application> whose purpose is to standardize the look
and feel and inter-process communications so that applications written by
different programmers end up looking and acting similarly. They also
assist programmers by supplying common elements.</para>
