There appears to be some compatibility issues for KDE that has been
compiled with the 3.0.x series of QT and then updated to the QT-3.1.0.
There also appears to be issues when KDE-3.0.x is compiled against
QT-3.1.0. If you are looking for a stable setup and the security
alerts for KDE do not affect you, KDE-3.0.4 compiled against QT-3.0.5 or
QT-3.0.6 is the way to go for now.</para></warning>
