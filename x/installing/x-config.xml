<title>Additional X Windows Configuration</title>

<para>Below you will find information on fine tuning the components of both 
variants of X Windows.  The documentation links are specifically for 
<application>XFree86</application> however, the information contained in 
those documents usually pertains to <application>Xorg</application> as 
well.</para>

<title>Mice</title>
<para>Multi-button mice can be used to their full potential by mapping the 
additional buttons to X button events.  Wheel mice are a common example.  The 
inexpensive ones contain two buttons, and a scroll wheel that doubles as 
a third button.  As far as <application>X</application> is concerned, there 
are 5 buttons as it counts the 'scroll up' and 'scroll down' functions 
(internally they are buttons). Here is an example 'InputDevice' section for 
a typical PS/2 wheel mouse:</para>

<para><screen>Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Mouse 0"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/mice"
	Option		"Protocol"	"IMPS/2"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"	"4 5"
	Option		"Buttons"	"5"
EndSection</screen></para>

<para>Button assignments differ for every mouse type.  On more exotic mice,
you may find that the rocker wheel buttons are 6 and 7.  Simply add those 
values to the <parameter>ZAxisMapping</parameter> option, and set the 
<parameter>Buttons</parameter> option appropriately to enable  side to 
side scrolling.  Additional information on button assignment can be found in 
the following <application>XFree86</application> document:</para>
