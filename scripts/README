These scripts are used to determine the latest stable versions of 
BLFS packages that are available upstreeam.

----
blfs-chapterxx.php -- These scripts examine the wget-list generated by the 
main book Makefile and check upstream servers for the latest versions.  In
many cases, the script can just take the url directly from the wget-list,
but in about a third of the cases, customization of the process is needed.

The scripts also determine the package names referenced from the wget-list, 
but in a few cases, the names must be modified by custom procedures.

The wget-list location and the directory for output html files 
(e.g. chapter4.html) will be in the current directory unless specified by 
environment variables.  For Chapter 24 (xorg), the location of the BLFS
xml sources is also needed.

For example:

WGET_DIR=/home/bdubbs/public_html/blfs-book-xsl/
HTML_DIR=/home/bdubbs/public_html/
BLFS_DIR=/home/bdubbs/BLFS/trunk/BOOK/

The scripts are numbered according to the BLFS chapter where they start. 
They cover one or more BLFS chapters according to the number of
packages in the chapters.

The scripts are a bit fragile as they rely on the format of upstream servers.
When the upstream servers change their location or format, then the scripts 
must be updated to conform to the changes.
----
update-blfs-currency.sh -- This is a simple script to run each of the 
blfs-chapterxx.php scripts in numerical order.  It is usually run from a
cron job once a day.
----
summ-blfs*.php -- These scripts examine the generated html files to determine 
non-current packages identified bu the blfs-chapterxx.php scripts.

The scripts fetch the current BLFS tickets from the Trac system running on 
linuxfromscratch.org and integrate that data from the parsed html files.

Output is either to a mail address or stdout depending on the version of the 
program.

The programs require wget and mailx.
