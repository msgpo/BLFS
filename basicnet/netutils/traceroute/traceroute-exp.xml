<para><screen><command>sed 's/-o bin/-o root/'...</command></screen>
Adjusts the <filename>Makefile</filename> so that the program is installed 
with user root instead of user bin (which doesn't exist on a default
<acronym>LFS</acronym> system).</para>

<para><command>make install</command>: Installs <command>traceroute</command> 
with <acronym>SUID</acronym> set to  root in the <filename>/usr/sbin</filename> directory. This makes it 
possible for all users to execute <command>traceroute</command>. For absolute 
security, turn off the <acronym>SUID</acronym> bit in <command>traceroute</command>'s file 
permissions with the command:</para>
<screen><command>chmod 0755 /usr/sbin/traceroute</command></screen>

<para>The risk is that if a security problem such as a buffer overflow was 
ever found in the <application>Traceroute</application> code, a regular user 
on your system could gain root access if the program is
<acronym>SUID</acronym> root. Of course, removing 
the <acronym>SUID</acronym> permission also makes it impossible for users other than 
root to utilize <command>traceroute</command>, so decide what's right for your 
individual situation.</para>

<para>Our aim is to be completely <acronym>FHS</acronym> compliant, so if 
you do leave the <command>traceroute</command> binary
<acronym>SUID</acronym> root, then you 
should move <filename>traceroute</filename> to <filename>/usr/bin</filename> 
with the following command:</para>
<screen><command>mv /usr/sbin/traceroute /usr/bin</command></screen>

<para>This ensures that the binary is in the path for non-root users.</para>
