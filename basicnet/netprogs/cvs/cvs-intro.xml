<para>CVS is the concurrent versioning system. This is useful for
projects on which multiple people are working or where archives of
previous versions of files need to be kept.</para>

<para>The <filename>cvs-1.11.2-zlib.patch</filename> patch is used to
compile CVS dynamically against zlib instead of using the version included
with the CVS source.  This has the advantage that if (or when) there is 
a security vulnerability found in zlib, you don't need to wait for a new
version of CVS to appear as once you have upgraded zlib, the problem will be
fixed.</para>
